# Changelog

## Unreleased

- While Octomux connects to its background service at launch (a few seconds right after an update), the window
  shows "Starting Octomux…" instead of an empty sidebar.

## 0.1.1

- Only one copy of Octomux runs at a time: opening a second copy (say, one in Downloads and one in
  Applications) asks which one to keep, instead of both taking over the background service.
- The background service follows the copy you open, once at launch; a copy that was left open no longer takes
  it back when it reconnects.

## 0.1.0 — first public release

- Sessions in a background daemon (launchd agent, one holder per session): they survive app quits, crashes,
  updates and daemon restarts; Claude Code and Codex resume their conversation after a reboot.
- Workspaces, projects, tabs, splits, dock; git worktrees; the right panel (Files, Changes with History, Sessions).
- Claude Code status (working / needs input / done), notifications, menu bar panel, chat view.
- Usage limits for Claude Code and Codex.
- Remote hosts over SSH.
- Themes, dark by default, and animated scenes (Octo Deep, Kraken, Tide Pool and more).
- Signed, notarized, and updates itself (Sparkle) without stopping your sessions.
